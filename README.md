This is a followup tutorial from JavaScript Mastery. It's one of the live projects created on the TailwindCSS Crash Course.

After coding the project, some slight modifications were made to the Hero section to reflect my thought process and add some richness to the design.

1. Design Process:
The process started off by creating the utility classes and updating our styling sheet. We used TailwindCSS. This was important so we don't clutter our components with styling data. Once that was settled, the next step was to create each of our components and start building them.

If you go through the design, you'll notice how clean the components are even though most of our data were not loaded via an API. They were documented in a folder called Constants, which we used to link data onto the site. For instance, data related to Navbar and the Footer were loaded using the Constants.

For the other details, the Hero section was far the most detailed and time consuming.

2. Site Features

These are some of the features that you can find on the site design

Visually stunning Hero Design: The hero design showcases key elements on the page inlcuding the above the fold data, attractive CTAs and the constantly changing hero images.

Popular Products: There's a popular product section that showcases some of the hottest products available on the site. It also comes with priciing and a rating system that's only visible on the front-end. It can't be toggled or changed.

About Us page and many more: We also have a 'about us' section, why you should 'shop with us' and a Special Offer section.
